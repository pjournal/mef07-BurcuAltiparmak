    "text": "2 Introduction\nHello, this is Burcu! I work as a senior manager at EY, Tax Technology and Transformation service line. I have a very fun and young team of 13 people. We run projects that design processes transforming our clients’ time-consuming tasks with technology. In our projects, we make extensive use of data analytics and robotic process automation tools. I believe that a Master’s program in Big Data Analytics will take my career to the next level. Learning and experiencing new tools can be challenging but also enjoyable!\nYou can find more about my professional background and connect with me on Linkedin !\nGet started with Quarto | Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel\nThis video helped me well for my first intend to implement my quarto assignment. I believe starting with this video will be beneficial.\nMillion Song Dataset:\nThe Million Song Dataset is a comprehensive music dataset containing information on millions of songs. It includes a range of musical features for each song, such as tempo, key, vocal content, danceability, and more. Additionally, it provides details about the song, artist, album, and music genre.\nKey Features:\nData Source: The Million Song Dataset was created by The Echo Nest and is hosted at Columbia University.
