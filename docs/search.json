    "text": "2 Introduction\nHello, this is Burcu! I work as a senior manager at EY, Tax Technology and Transformation service line. I have a very fun and young team of 13 people. We run projects that design processes transforming our clients’ time-consuming tasks with technology. In our projects, we make extensive use of data analytics and robotic process automation tools. I believe that a Master’s program in Big Data Analytics will take my career to the next level. Learning and experiencing new tools can be challenging but also enjoyable!\nYou can find more about my professional background and connect with me on Linkedin !\nGet started with Quarto | Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel\nThis video helped me well for my first intend to implement my quarto assignment. I believe starting with this video will be beneficial.\nMillion Song Dataset:\nThe Million Song Dataset is a comprehensive music dataset containing information on millions of songs. It includes a range of musical features for each song, such as tempo, key, vocal content, danceability, and more. Additionally, it provides details about the song, artist, album, and music genre.\nKey Features:\nData Source: The Million Song Dataset was created by The Echo Nest and is hosted at Columbia University. This dataset is publicly available for research and educational purposes.\nAccess: For access to the Million Song Dataset and more detailed information, you can visit the official website.\nThis dataset is suitable for analyzing music genres, classifying songs, learning about music, or enhancing your data science skills in an educational project. You can find detailed information and access instructions on the official website linked above."

    "text": "5.1 Project Portfolio Optimization at Hewlett Packard\n\n5.1.1 Business Case:\nManaging a portfolio of IT projects efficiently poses a significant challenge due to the vast number of project combinations, conflicting business objectives, and resource constraints. The former Hewlett Packard Global IT organization faced difficulties in manually optimizing portfolios, leading to sub-optimal results, wasted resources, and project delays.\n\n\n5.1.2 Problem Description:\nThe challenge was to optimize the selection and scheduling of a portfolio of IT projects while considering conflicting business objectives, resource constraints (e.g., labor availability, budgets), and project precedence constraints. The complexity increased with the split/merge of Hewlett Packard into four companies: HP Inc., Hewlett Packard Enterprise, DXC Technology, and Micro Focus.\n\n\n5.1.3 Solution:\nTo address this, a decision support tool named Project Portfolio Optimization (PPO) was developed. PPO automated the complex calculations involved in creating and maintaining an IT project portfolio. The tool incorporated a “what-if-analysis” feature, allowing business and IT planners to shape a portfolio that optimally balanced various business objectives, considering resource and business constraints.\n\n5.1.3.1 Key Features of PPO:\n\nDecision variables: Selection of IT projects and their start times.\nInput data from Business Value Proposition (BVP) and Project Portfolio Management (PPM) tools.\nAbility to handle single or multiple business objectives using lexicographical (hierarchical) method.\nOutput: Maximization of project portfolio business value, considering budget, resource, scheduling, and strategic alignment constraints.\n\n\n\n5.1.3.2 Benefits:\n\nEfficiency: Automation reduced manual efforts, making the portfolio optimization process more efficient.\nOptimized Trade-offs: PPO enabled decision-makers to optimize trade-offs between conflicting business objectives.\nReal-time Updates: Incremental updates in the staging area ensured timely and accurate information, adapting to changes in business conditions.\nMultiple Scenarios: The tool’s optimization scenario queue manager allowed simultaneous solving of multiple scenarios, enhancing decision-making flexibility.\n\nIn summary, the implementation of Project Portfolio Optimization provided Hewlett Packard Global IT with a sophisticated tool to tackle the complexities of managing IT project portfolios, resulting in more efficient resource utilization and better alignment with business objectives.\n\nplease click here to explore more about the Hewlett Packard Project Portfolio Optimization."
